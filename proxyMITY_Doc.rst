As the name suggests, “ProxyMITY” serves as a “proxy”, i.e. it provides virtual closeness
(proximity) without the actual classroom. It is a “proxy Multimedia Integration Tool for You”, that
helps teachers create dynamic rich-media lectures.

“ProxyMITY Lectures viewed on Aakash” is an Open source software product. Published lecture
that are released under the Creative Commons License by Attributions 2.5 are edited and
prepared for distribution using ProxyMITY.

The main goal of this tool is to develop the ProxyMITY tool on Android Platform using Eclipse,
android SDK and ADT Plugins to view the lecture videos present in the SD-Card or on a Server
using Aakash tablet. Features such as Bookmarking a video and playing subtitles along with the
video have been added. Android SQLite database is used for storing the bookmarked videos. The
user will be able to update the bookmarks. The srt files for the videos can also be played by
choosing from a list of srt files.
